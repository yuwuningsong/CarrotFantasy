review/stars on the store it's really important for publishers...

QUESTIONS : 

- "I want to avoid the delay during instanciation? How it's possible?"
Take a look on the folder called : Example_02 you should find some stuff :)


- "I want to avoid the delay during instanciation on mobile? How it's possible?"

The delay come, because unity duplicate the texture and the prefab during instanciation. In fact the textures pack are setuped to 4086 width. Just downscale to 2048 to get off the problem.


- "I don't know Shuriken, how i can just shoot one time the prefab? Don't loop?"

for one shoot emitters check the bitmap called : Help For One Shoot.png
